For example, when making or completing a crossword you may want to find a word that has 4 letters, starts with *J* and ends with *A*. In this assignment, the program you will write will create a lexicon of words from various text files.\n",
        "\n",
        "A **word** is a sequence of letters. Words will be treated in a case-insensitive manner. A simple option is to store all the words in lower case. Initially, a word is obtained as a sequence of characters separated by whitespace characters. Then numbers and punctuation characters, if any, must be removed. More specifically:\n",
        "* If the word \"and\" occurs twice in the file, it is only stored once in the lexicon.\n",

        "    * \"cathy\" is not *w*'s neighbour, for they are not of the same length.\n",
